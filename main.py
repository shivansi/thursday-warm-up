#VARIABLE- store a piece of data
a=2 #integer
b="3"#string

print(a+a)
print(b+b) 

#what are the 2 characteristics of data? value and data type

#for loop
for i in range(5):
  print("hi",i)

#while
smelly=True
while smelly==True:
  print("idk")
  smelly=False

counter=0
while counter<5:
  print(counter)
  counter+=1

#1. Give me an example of a string variable and an integer variable
#2. Create your OWN for loop
#3. Create your OWN while loop
#4. In a comment, provide an example of when to use:
     # a) a variable
     # b) a loop
     # c) a conditionals
#5. Provide any questions that you currently have or provide a concept you're confused about.

a=8
b="uh"

for j in range(4):
  print("hii",j)

lol=False
while lol==False:
  print("hahaha")
  lol=True

#functions
def greeting():
  print("hey")
def goodbye():
  print("adios")
greeting()
goodbye()

num1=input("enter one number")
num2=input("enter another number")

print(num1+num2)

#a) you use a variable if you want to store a single piece of information
#b) you use a loop when you want your code to repeat
#c) you use conditionals when you want the computer to do a specific thing for one condition, and when you want the computer to do the opposite(?)
